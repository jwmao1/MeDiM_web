            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <div class="abs">
                Advances in generative medical models are often constrained by modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary evidence, such as imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits their development to true foundation models that empower medical AI agents to learn from and predict across the full spectrum of biomedical knowledge. To address the challenges, we propose <b>MeDiM</b>, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across different medical modalities without requiring modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: it flexibly translates between images and text or jointly produces image–report pairs across domains in response to user prompts.
                It builds on a discrete diffusion framework that unifies vision and language modeling by modeling their shared probabilistic distribution. To empower the diffusion process to support unified and versatile medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its rich prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning abilities.
                Because MLLMs are trained with causal (autoregressive) masking while diffusion denoising benefits from bidirectional context, MeDiM introduces two key designs: 1) <i>removing the causal attention mask to enable a fully bidirectional information flow essential for mutual alignment</i>, and 2) <i>injecting continuous timestep embeddings to make the MLLM aware of the diffusion steps</i>. Extensive experiments validate MeDiM as a unified foundation model capable of high-fidelity medical generation across various domains. It achieves high-quality generation on various tasks, including medical image generation (16.60 FID on MIMIC-CXR; 24.19 FID on PathGen) and report generation (0.2650 METEOR on MIMIC-CXR; 0.2580 METEOR on PathGen). In addition, the jointly generated medical pairs improve downstream performance (+6.43% BLEU-1, +18.57% BLEU-2, +31.58% BLEU-3, and +4.80% METEOR in PathGen), which achieves access to multimodal inputs and generate coherent, clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

            <h2>Framework</h2>
            <div class="abs">
                <b>Overview of the MeDiM architecture</b>. The framework integrates an MLLM backbone within a discrete diffusion process for unified medical multimodal generation. During the forward process, data is tokenized and diffused over timesteps. The MLLM is then trained to reverse this process. Key architectural adaptations, including causal attention removal, timestep embeddings, and AdaLN, adapt the autoregressive MLLM for the bidirectional denoising required for unified medical generation.

Areas show dense cellularity, loss of normal stratification, with invasive, atypical cells and stromal invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Moderate inflammatory cells are also present. Keratin pearls confirms a poorly differentiated squamous intraepithelial lesion ( (HSIL), likely an invasive carcinoma. Active mitotic figures confirm rapid cell division a high proliferative index known as a neoplastic condition in the epithelium, along with tissue disorganization features deviates from squamous epithelium, consistent with invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Key findings include include architectural disorder and abnormal mitotic figures, and invasive, atypical cells into fibrous, inflamed stroma, with spindle-shaped cells.</p>

The clear cell cytoplasm dissolved in the cytoplasm due to dissolved and eosinophilic and pleomorphism. The tissue architecture is distorted, lacking normal renal structures, suggesting the malignancy, the most common subtype of renal carcinoma. L regions show clear cytoplasm, dissolved due to lipids/carbohydrate accumulation or carbohydrates, and stromal necrosis, significant vascular invasion. These features indicate a renal neuroendocrine subtype of lateral carcinoma, specifically clear cell RCC. Nuclei are visible post-staining, with abundant cytoplasm due to dissolved lipids and unremarkable nuclei. No organized glomeruli or tubules is visible, further support the diagnosis, characterized as renal cell carcinoma or a tubular-inian neoplasm.</p>

Tubular atrophy and dilation suggests potential damage. No necrosis. Absence of clear glomeruli further suggest infiltration. These findings point to xantholytic interstitial macrophages or lipid macrophages, potentially associated with lipiduriarelated material and lipid pathology. The findings suggest a renal pathology linked to proteinuria or disease. The glomerular glomerulus suggests an ongoing inflammatory process, likely related to respiratory kidney disorder. Confirmation requires further testing for specific renal pathology. Key pathology include tubular atrophy, interstitial inflammation, and edema in the sinusoids, evidenced by cellularity at the magnification and accompanied by chronic inflammatory response. disease.

The disorganized arrangement and variable cellularity suggest a possible reactive or reparative process, possibly benign myofibroblastic or fibroblastic proliferation, in lung connective tissue. The uniformity in cell size and shape indicates no signs of malignancy. Possible diagnoses include leiomyoma or chronic fibrosis or indicating a well-aligned, myofibroblasticblastic proliferation. There's a benign proliferation of small, dark-staining nuclei suggesting inflammatory cell components or other cells, indicating a well-organized structure. The morphology maintains no evidence of malignancy or tissue disruption,isive of a reactive, active pathological change, possibly idiopath of interstitial lung disease, such as fibrosis.</p>

Varied gus-to-back gland ratio and visible nucleoli are observed. Inflammation, scant stroma, minimal inflammation between epithelial cells, and architectural distortion, indicate a possible neoplastic process. No invasive growth or deep invasion is seen, aligning with a diagnosis of a tubular adenomatous polyp, with possible high-to-mid dysplastic tumor growth. The stroma is moderately cellular. Findings indicate mild regenerative changes without high-grade dysplasia, but if into are not adenomas or adenomarcinoma. The glands vary in volume, however, shows architectural distortion, secretion of left-sided eosinophilic secretions, suggestive of a low-grade malignancy.</p>

The pink-staining cytoplasm indicates eosinophilic filaments. Moderate collagenous extracellular matrix surrounds the cells. There are no signs of inflammation or necrosis, suggesting a sp muscle structure, from the stomach's muscularis propria of the stomach. No hepatocellular architecture is noted. Diagnosis remains uncertain without further tests. No inflammation, necrosis, or significant malignancy is evident; however, the findings suggest non-neoplastic, contraamed, vascular, and muscular tissue, typical of present bladder's pyloric smooth muscle.

The surrounding stroma shows fibrous tissue, containing inflammatory cells and small vessels. E-cad DCIS features. Confirmation requires further clinical and non-R7 molecular evaluation. These findings are indicative of E-kvasive ductal breast carcinoma, likely the micropapillary subtype of lumen, with characteristics of cells filled within ducts characteristic of mucinous neoplastic, solid.

Scant cytoplasm and a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio indicate potential invasiveness. Differential diagnosis: endometrial carcinoma. Fibrosis, vascularization, pink stromal material, and inflammatory cells hint at hyperplasia or carcinoma. Compressed glands examined by atypical epithelial cells are noted, but definitive diagnosis requires further testing. The history of endometrial cancer, PR, endometrioid adenal adenocarcinoma, with overall disorganized architecture and pleomorphism, likely support the uterus. The features suggest a high-grade, aggressive, uncontrolled vascularization, cellular proliferation with overcrosing blue-staining stromal cells and absent normal glandular structures.

No clear clear demarcation of liver pathology or significant inflammation is visible. The presence of congestedusoid hints at fibrosis or cirrhosis; Likely conditions include reactive changes, hyperplasia, steatosis, or heastatic carcinoma.
